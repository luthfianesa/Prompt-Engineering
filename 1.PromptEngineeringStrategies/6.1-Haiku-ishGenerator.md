  Crafting questions sharp,
  Guiding thought with precision,
  Answers clearer shine,

  - Improve the following prompts to build a simple Haiku generator with ChatGPT :

    1. Make some lists of phrases for a haiku. I want them to be about artificial intelligence
    2. Combine the phrases into a haiku
    3. Make the haikus show up when i press a button

  - **Note:**
    - ChatGPT is prone to mistakes when counting syllables.
    - For 100% accuracy, prompt chatGPT to break down each line and count the syllables.

```
Hints:

# Build a Haiku Generator in 3 prompts

1. Because a haiku follows a 5-7-5 syllable format, you'll need
   to ask ChatGPT to generate three JavaScript arrays, one for each
   line of the haiku.

2. You'd need a function that randomly selects one entry from each
   of the three arrays and returns a combined string-- this is
   your haiku!

3. You'll need to prompt ChatGPT to write the HTML and JS for a button
   that will trigger your haiku generating function and display it to the
   webpage.

  ```

- **Mentor Prompt**

```
/*
Prompt: "Generate 3 JavaScript arrays for a haiku generator where each array represents a line of the haiku.
The first and third arrays should contain phrases with 5 syllables, and the second array should contain phrases with 7 syllables.
All the phrases should relate to artificial intelligence."

const lineOne = [
    "Machines start to think",
    "Neural nets begin to weave",
    "Silicon dreams spin",
    "Bytes become insights",
    "In the hum of code"

    "Algorithms grow, evolve free",
    "In the depth of ones and zeroes",
    "Deep Blue to neural flows",

const lineThree = [
    "Future now seems near",
    "Code's poetry takes flight",
    "Minds meld, wires entwined",

/*
Prompt: "Write a Javascript function to randomly select one string from 3 arrays of strings,
and return a combined string where each haiku is on a separate line"

function generateHaiku(lineOne, lineTwo, lineThree) {
  const getRandomLine = (array) => array[Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length)];

  const firstLine = getRandomLine(lineOne);
  const secondLine = getRandomLine(lineTwo);
  const thirdLine = getRandomLine(lineThree);

  return `${firstLine}\n${secondLine}\n${thirdLine}`;
}

/*
Prompt : " Create a button in JavaScript that, when clicked,
triggers the generateHaiku function and displays the haiku to the webpage".
*/


document.getElementById('generateButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
const haiku = generateHaiku(lineOne, lineTwo, lineThree);
document.getElementById('haikuOutput').textContent = haiku;
});
