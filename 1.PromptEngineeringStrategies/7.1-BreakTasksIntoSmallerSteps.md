## Breaking It Down

- Break tasks or instructions into small steps
- Build features / applications in smaller chunks
- Read and understand the code along the way

## Why Smaller Steps ?

- Manageability
- Learning and Understanding
- Isolate bugs and other issues

## Not Recommended Prompt:

```
Help me build a small React application to help users visualize their budget.
The application should consist of a form with three inputs: a budget title, a total budget and current expenditures.
When the user submits the form, a progress bar should be added to the page.
The progress bar should be green if less than 50% of the budget has been reached,
orange if more than 75% oof the budget has been reached, and red if 100% or more of the budget has been reached.
The app should keep track of the total budget and total expenditures,
and display a larger progress bar with this info at the top of the page.
Users should also be able to delete and edit progress bars.
Create JSON for 4 example budget progress bars.
Assume I already have a React project set up
```

- The result :
  - No progress bars
  - Ignored request for add and delete functionality
  - Ignored main progress bar style request

## How Would You Break It Down ?

- Structure and style
- By components
- By features
- Something else ?

## Improved Prompt:

```
Help me build a small React application to help users visualize their budget.
Make sure it meets the following requirements:
  1. Include a form component with three inputs: budget title, budget and spent
  2. When the form is submitted, add the new budget to an array of budgets


Add styles to the form. Assume from an external stylesheet.
Make sure the example css addresses the following:
  - Should be responsive
  - Form fields stack one on top of another
  - Field are styled similar to Bootstrap form fields (but do not introduce any outside libraries)


Display each budget in the budget array as a progress bar.
Each progress bar component should have the following:
  - Display budget title
  - Display budget / spent below the progress bar
  - Progress bar should be red if 100% or more of the budget has been reached, orange if 75%
  or more of the budget has been reached, and green if less than 74% of the budget has been reached
  - Progress bar styles: thick with rounded corners


Create dummy budget data so i can test my application.
Here is a reminder of what data comes in from the form:

<form onSubmit={onSubmit}>
 <input type="text" value={title} onChange={e=> setTitle(e.target.value)}
 placeholder="Budget Title" required />
 <input type="number" value={budget} onChange={e=> setBudget(e.target.value)}
 placeholder="Spent" required/>
 <button type="submit">Add Budget</button>
</form>


I want to make the following changes to the progress bar component:
1. The width of the progress bar should never exceed 100%.
If the spent amount exceeds the budget amount, the maximum width is 100%
2. If the spent amount exceeds the budget amount, make the budget/spent progress bar text red
3. Display the spent/budget text as a dollar amount
4. Use dark pastel colors for the progress bars
```
