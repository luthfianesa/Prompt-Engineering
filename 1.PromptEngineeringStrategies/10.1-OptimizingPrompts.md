## Optimizing Prompts

# 2 Stages

- 1. Ask ChatGPT to Interview Us
- 2. Prompt ChatGPT to maximze the result

### Prompt Example:

```
I'm going to give you a prompt, and i want you to help me optimize it.
Ask me clarifying questions, then suggest a more effective prompt that will yield a more accurate
and detailed output. Got it ?
```

### ChatGPT Output:

```
Absolutely, I'd be happy to help optimize your prompt. Please share it with me
```

### Next Prompt:

```
Give me some example code of React accordion menu.
```

### ChatGPT Output:

```
Thank you for sharing the prompt. To help optimize it. I'd like to ask a few claryfing questions:

1. Would you prefer the React accordion menu to be made with class components or functional components using hooks ?
2. Are there any specific features you'd like the accordion menu to have? (e.g., multiple sections open at the same time, animations, accessibility features, etc)
3. Will there be any specific data structure for the content of the accordion, or will it be text only?
4. Would you like the use of a specific styling strategy (like CSS, CSS-in-JS or any UI framework like Bootstrap, Material UI?)

Once i have this information. I'll be able to provide a much more specific and optimized prompt.
```

### Next Prompt:

```
1. Functional Components
2. I want a smooth open and close animation. Only one section needs to be open at a time.
   I'd also like to use the Open Sans google font.
3. The accordion should accept JSON data. Genereate some dummy data for me.
4. Just a regular external stylesheet, please
```

### ChatGPT Output:

```
Thank you for the additional details, they're really helpful. Based on your requirements, here is the revised and optimized prompt:

"Could you provide me with example code for a React accordion menu that meets the
following requirements?

1. The accordion should be implemented using functional components with hooks
2. The menu should support smooth open and close animations and allow only one section to be open at a time
3. The accordion should be capable of accepting JSON data. Please also generate some dummy JSON data
   for the purpose of this example
4. The styling should be handled through an external CSS stylesheet
5. The design should incorporoate the Open Sans Google Font

Please ensure the example code includes both the React component code as well as the associated CSS"
```

### ChatGPT Output:

Sure, let's break down this task. We will use the 'useState' hook for
managing the state of the currently opened item and 'useEffect' to load the dummy JSON data.
For the animation, we will use CSS Transitions

Firstly, let's create the Accordion.js component:

const dummyData = [
  { title: 'Section 1', content: 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.' },
  { title: 'Section 2', content: 'Consectetur adipiscing elit.' },
  { title: 'Section 3', content: 'Vestibulum mollis sem et nunc cursus porta.' },
  // Add as many sections as you want
];

const Accordion = () => {
  const [activeIndex, setActiveIndex] = useState(null);

  const toggleItem = (index) => {
    setActiveIndex(index === activeIndex ? null : index);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    // Here you can replace dummyData with an API request to fetch the JSON data
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="accordion">
      {dummyData.map((item, index) => (
        <div className="accordion-item" key={index}>
          <div className="accordion-title" onClick={() => toggleItem(index)}>
            {item.title}
            <div className={`accordion-icon ${index === activeIndex ? 'rotate' : ''}`}>^</div>
          </div>
          <div className={`accordion-content ${index === activeIndex ? 'show' : ''}`}>
            {item.content}
          </div>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Accordion;
```
