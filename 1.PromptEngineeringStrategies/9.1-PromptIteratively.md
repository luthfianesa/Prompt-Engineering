      <tr>
        <th>Game Name</th>
        <th>Category</th>
        <th>Players</th>
        <th>Age Group</th>
        <th>Price</th>

### Revised / Tweaked Prompt :

```
Please create a product web page based on this HTML table. Use a responsive gallery
format where each product is a tile. Convert the data in the HTML table to JSON and use JavaScript to loop through and display each game:

  <h1>Role With It Games Inventory</h1>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Game Name</th>
        <th>Category</th>
        <th>Players</th>
        <th>Age Group</th>
        <th>Price</th>
        <th>Stock</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
  </table>
```
