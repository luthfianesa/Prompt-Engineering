```
"I want to design the front end for a pet adoption app from scratch.
This app should have a user-friendly UI that displays a comprehensive list of pets,
each with a photo, name, age, and brief description.
Users should be able to click on a pet to see a detailed profile,
including its medical history and dietary requirements.
I also need mechanisms for filtering pets by various criteria
and want to ensure the design is mobile-responsive and
adheres to accessibility standards. How can I tackle this?"
```
